            <p>I am now at my third year of studying Bachelor of Science in Computer
                Engineering in Cavite State University - Cavite College of Arts and Trades
                Campus. In my educational journey, I have been awarded scholarships under
                both non-governmental organization (NGO) and government sponsorship
                schemes as a way to acknowledge my effort and outstanding academic
                performance. Being an academic scholar has instilled in me a strong work ethic
                and a commitment to maintaining high academic standards.</p>
            <p>I am passionate about web development, programming, and technology.  
                I enjoy creating websites, solving technical problems, and continuously learning 
                new skills to enhance my knowledge in the field. I have a keen interest in problem-solving and innovation, always 
                looking for new ways to improve systems and processes. I enjoy working on group projects, collaborating with others,
                and using my technical skills to achieve our goals. I am always open to learning and expanding my knowledge, believing
                 that growth comes from embracing new challenges and experiences. My goal in life is to use my engineering background to make
                  a meaningful impact, particularly in the fields of sustainable technology and innovation.  </p>
